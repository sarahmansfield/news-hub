# Shiny News Hub Dashboard

### About the App

This interactive Shiny dashboard provides the latest and breaking news 
headlines across the United States, as well as worldwide. It utilizes the
[News API](https://newsapi.org/) to extract the latest news headlines 
from over 30,000 news sources, and allows users to search for articles 
that match certain criteria. 

The dashboard also makes use of [SENTIM-API](https://sentim-api.herokuapp.com),
an API for sentiment analysis. This feature within the dashboard allows users 
to receive information on the overall polarity of article features, such as 
the title and/or description.
